# Project-1

# Description

We were asked to create an app that uses two APIs. Our team created a stock trading website where you can trade stocks with simulated currency. There is a log in/sign up, a CBC feed, a NY Times trending news page, a real time stock search that shows price, change and shows a graph, and there is also a user portfolio where it shows what stocks you' purchased along with your remaining cash.

## Issues

The main issues were figuring out how to use modals, figuring out how to implement a stock buying feature, and implementing the graph using chart.js.
